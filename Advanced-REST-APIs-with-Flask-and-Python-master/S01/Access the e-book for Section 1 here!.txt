Welcome to the course once again!

In order to get up to speed, in this section we'll be looking at a basic REST API. It's something we learned about in the introductory course, but I appreciate you may not have taken that course!

To help you with this section, we've written an e-book. You can read it, reference it, or treat it as an extra way to understand the starting code and what goes on in our first REST API.

Access the e-book here.

Together with the videos, it should be plenty to get you acquainted with REST APIs with Flask and Python!

As always, if you have any questions, fire away in the Course Q&A or the Slack channel (which you can join by clicking this link: http://slack.tecla.do)
